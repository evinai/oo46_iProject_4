"All of my shipping estimates doubled over night. Like Friday the 8th is now the minimum prime delivery for anything on the store, what gives?"
"I purchased a large item, over 100 pounds, which arrived damaged.  Third party seller...  Wants me to pay to return the damaged item to get refund/replacement.  reading the amazon help page rules, since the seller did provide a self addressed label, they have complied with their requirements.  The seller 'suggests' Fed Ex with insurance for returns.  A preliminary shipping cost estimate based on weight and location is almost $200 for a $600 item.  

What, if any, suggestions or recourse do I have to get the damaged item replaced without spending more money?"

Really odd, no idea what has happened, worried I have been hacked but can't see how. I think I purchased an item from an individual seller, any chance he has tried some sort of scam?"
"If I use a gift card, does the credit card get charged?

If I'm part of a Household, can the primary account see what I've ordered?

The reason for these questions is that I want to buy my mom a Christmas present using a gift card I got using Microsoft Rewards. But Ive found out that I can't use the gift card unless there is another payment option in place

I don't have a credit card to use so I'd be using my mom's. I won't be telling her it's for the gift tho. I'm thinking about asking for the card details for a free trial of some sort. So obviously I don't want there to be any kind of charge or notice. For example, I'm worried that she'd get a $0.00 charge or something. I've never had a credit card so idk how they work

Secondly, when I sign into my Amazon account, I notice that the top left logo changes from ""Amazon"" to ""Amazon Prime"". Does this mean I have Prime benefits? From what I've learned, it should be a yes. When checking out the ""Manage Household"" setting, my account is there along with my mom's and brothers. So we must be sharing prime benefits, right? If I were to buy something, would she be notified on her account/email. Such as ""Order details"" or ""Shipping Progress"" stuff? I don't want her to see the gift

That's pretty much all I'm asking as of now. I'd really appreciate some help. If I can't get any definitive answers, I'll probably just tell her I want to buy her a gift with a gift card and explain my worries. She'll have an answer for the credit card question but I doubt she'll have an answer to the Household question.

It's not a big deal but It'd be fun to have it a surprise"
"Account put on hold for no reason, and no matter how many documents I give them they won’t remove it

So I’ve had a hold on my account ever since October, for buying a sweater. That’s all there is to it, just a regular Columbia sweater. I bought one and then they put my account on hold. The worst part of it is that despite following the instructions as closely as possible, no matter how many documents I give, they never actually look over them and just keep my account on hold. I’ve sent them documents 6 times, and I’m nowhere closer. Does anyone know how to contact a human representative directly and get this issue fixed, or at least an actual way to get it fixed?"
"Sent something back to Amazon with their pick up from home service (UPS or DHL) but I forgot to put return slip into the box, am I fkd? its a £300 item  
their instructions said no need to print, they bring a label, so I just packed it back, put it in the box and was waiting for driver. After they left I was expecting for the status to update that they started the refund, but no update. then I looked into it more and it says they start the refund when they get it and that they were telling me there to print the return slip and put it in the box.  
I am worried cuz its a £300 item that I sent back."
"Wish list question: 

My wife started a holiday wish list and added me as a collaborator. I bought one of the items on the list, and now there's a dialog on the list that says ""Needs 1 has 1.""

"I purchased a $300 item at a discounted black Friday price but only received an empty box.

  
I contacted customer service and was told I can't replace the item and can only get a refund.  
Having to reorder the item would be at the non-discounted price. The refund was in the form of a gift card while the $300 charge stays on my card and ""...interest will be imposed from the date of purchase at a rate of 29.99%.""

  
HERE ARE MY QUESTIONS:  
1 - If I used a non Amazon credit card, would the refund still be in the form of a gift card?  


2 - Is there a way to get the charge refunded to the credit card instead of receiving gift card credit? I communicated over chat. The only option was refund. They didn't offer to have it ""returned to original payment"". I had no idea it would be a gift card and thought my credit card would be credited.  
3 - My ""Your Orders"" page has this text associated with the order, ""Please return the item once it’s been delivered to you."" But I only received an empty box. I never received the item. I was denied a replacement and could only get a refund. What can I do to prevent ""if the item(s) are not in original condition or missing parts/accessories/manuals, we will charge you the previously refunded amount"" from occurring. 

""If we do not receive the expected product(s) and quantity as submitted by you in your return request, or if the item(s) are not in original condition or missing parts/accessories/manuals, we will charge you the previously refunded amount (or for the previously shipped replacement/exchange order).""? (hyper link to policy on amazon removed per the mods)

4 - Why was I unable to reorder (replace) the item at the discounted price that I originally ordered it at?

5 - Is it policy to not allow discounted pricing upon re-order when amazon makes a mistake with the shipping? The policy of not allowing to reorder at the same discounted price when amazon makes a shipping mistake seems like a policy easy for sellers to abuse. If the seller makes their quota of sales at the discount, then ship an empty box and wait for a re-order at the non-discounted price."

Issue with checking out on all platforms including the iPhone app, in browser, and in browser on PC

I’m just wondering if anyone else has encountered this issue before. 
I put a cart together for the holiday, a rather large one, and tried to check out as usual, but when I try to press “go to checkout” it just reloads my cart. 

This issue is present on my account, not the app, as it is replicable in browser or app on multiple devices. 

I have checked for updates, I have uninstalled the app, I have done everything I can think of including removing each item from my cart, removing *all* items from my cart except one (something I did with each individual item), and calling support twice. The first time, they told me to just wait and see if the issue corrected itself in a few hours. The second time I was told to start a new account, which I cannot do because like many people I only have the one phone number. 

This is absolutely absurd and the items in my cart are mostly sale items so I’m getting a *little bit* frustrated. 

Has anyone experienced this or maybe know of a solution? 

Thanks


Edit **I have realized that I can use the “buy now option, but that is not a solution as I don’t feel like spending an extra hundred dollars just on shipping or losing it on cart value, please don’t suggest I do so**"

They also say there’s some “problem with order” button which also doesn’t exist. The only thing close is the problem with DELIVERY button which does nothing but give you different options for a return which is not what i’m interested in.

"I've had some weird stuff going on with my amazon account recently. Wondering if anyone else had been to/has in the past.

First one was 3 random items in my search history and 3 different items then those in my shopping cart. I logged out on my laptop and on a separate device I changed my password and set up OTP. Never logged back in to my laptop with the new password. I also removed all payment methods linked to that account. I contacted support asking if there was a way to check devices logged in / locations and they told me to wait for their expert department to reach out to me.

Second thing while I waited. On my non signed into amazon laptop I went to amazon and 4 things were in my cart. Not my account so I checked my phone which was the only device with my new password and it was fine. Just 4 random items in my pc that hadn't been connected to the internet much due to my isp being down for 48 hours and not connected to my account since I never logged it in. I was considering this to be a malware issue on my laptop until.

Third thing that happened was on my phone my last order is completely missing from my orders. Yes I can check the email for confirmation and to view it using that link, but it's completely gone from my order history. If I go to the item page I can see my ""last purchased"" date and also get order details that way. But it's not archived, and not searchable within my order history at all. Oh should add that the purchased was delivered like a week ago and only disappeared from my order history yesterday.

Finally amazon's experts contacted me giving me instructions on how to dispute unauthorized charges with my credit card issuer so they were absolutely zero help."
"I ordered a 3 meter Apple Thunderbolt 4 cable directly from Amazon listed as ""Used - Like New"", just to save a few bucks. What I received was a Chinese bootleg named CUXNCO, roughly 1.8m long. It was in the original packaging, but apparently the previous buyer made a return and replaced the cable for a cheap one. I turned out the one to bear this cost. Since Amazon doesn't ship to my country, I always resort to mail forwarders. But Amazon only agreed to refund me if I go to the United States and process the return via a UPS store. That's how they treat long-time customers with a solid order history (recently bought a $6500 MacBook from them and many other expensive stuff). And by the way, what a great idea. Guys, apparently you can also buy whatever items from Amazon, then replace them with similar-looking cheap ones and return them - no one is going to even check the contents. This is your Amazon for you."

"Hi all,

I have an basic amazon account though I infrequently use it - my last purchase was in May of this year. I learned yesterday that I had been signed up for Amazon Prime and was charged the Canadian fee of $9.99 + tax, with a renewal in January. I did NOT sign up for it and was completely off my phone for the majority of the day.

Has this ever happened to anyone? What are the possible reasons this might have happened? Would amazon be willing to reverse the subscription one day after its activation? I really don't have a need for Prime at all

The reason I ask is because I made a number of returns recently while working on a home improvement project (and having to try a number of options to see what would work and what wouldn’t). Shortly after I made the returns, it started making it required for me to leave an explanation when I checked “bought by mistake.”

I’m wondering whether this was a universal change to all accounts? Or if it’s just my account and perhaps they are upset by my recent level of returns?

Would you mind checking your account by pressing the button to return a recent purchase, choosing the option that you “bought by mistake,” and then looking on the next page to see if it indicates the box where you type up an explanation is optional or required?"

"Hi guys,  
  
After around 15 years paying Prime and being an Amazon Customer, I was about to be scammed.  
  
I ordered a 2.5k laptop 2 weeks ago from Amazon Marketplace, confident in Amazon protecting me in case of anything. The day of the delivery, I was home all day and the parcel was marked delivered, even though I did not get it. I checked with the Tracking and seems the parcel was signed off by someone else. I opened a dispute with both the seller and the shipping company, and I found out that the parcel was delivered to the wrong address. The delivery driver went there for a few days after it and discovered that the property is used for Airbnb. Shipping company also informed me that the seller sent it there, and the label did show the wrong address.  
  
Upon informing the seller about the mess, they give the fault to the courier and refused to refund me or send me a replacement. I claimed the refund through Amazon, showing them the emails from the courier as well as I police report, and they denied me the refund twice, telling me that I do these claims all the time and that my account could be blocked. I asked both through phone and emails, to please write me an history of claims I have made but they told me that my account is in good standing.  
  
I informed the seller that I would pursue them legally and got the refund after a few days by the seller.  
  
Always used Amazon and never had a problem, not sure why this time they denied me the refund and told me I do this all the time. Anyone had similar experience?"

"Trouble with order - advice needed

I have a somewhat unique situation and not sure where else to go to for advice. I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit to post. 

I placed an order on November 7th for a high end PC (~$4300) that had 5 in stock and had an estimated delivery date of November 10th. The 10th came and went and they pushed the delivery date to the 21st so I looked elsewhere and ended up buying the same PC from Best Buy. 

When I went to cancel my order with Amazon, my best guess is my account was flagged for fraudulent activity regarding the PC as the order for the PC just didn’t show up in my order history anymore… all other orders before/after were there. I spoke with easily a dozen customer service reps over the next week about this and they all told me the same thing which was the “concerned team” would reach out within 48 hours but nobody ever did.  

Eventually i started getting automated emails about my account being reinstated and the specific order was back up and showed in my order history. When I would go to cancel the order via the order history i would get conflicting messages. The pop up message would say cancellation request was successful but then i would get emails saying they were unable to cancel the order. I spoke with easily ~30-40 customer service reps this time about cancelling and they all told me that it was taken care of but they all started the conversations confused about the situation. 

Well my worst fears happened and i was just charged and received an email saying the order is shipped with a delivery date later this week. 

What are my courses of action? Refuse to sign/take delivery of the computer when the carrier attempts delivery as it requires signature? Dispute the charge with my credit card? The Amazon customer service has been impossibly unhelpful through this entire deal."

"Hey everyone, I need some help with an order issue if anyone has some direction or advice. I placed an order for a panty for about $190. The delivery date was scheduled for today but a week ago I got an email stating delivery would be delayed which was totally fine.
This morning I woke up to an email stating that the pantry was returned to Amazon and that I was being refunded. I was super bummed because we had already waited a month for it to ship out (we live in AK so shipping can be rough even with prime), but it is what it is.
Today I came home to the box delivered at my door. I tried going through Amazon to notify them it was delivered, albeit slightly damaged on some of the corners. I saw that items are refunded for being returned, damaged, or refused by buyer/seller, so I almost wonder if I was refunded because of reported damage during shipping by the post office to Amazon, or if it was a weird system error thing. 
Going through Amazon was in fact like trekking the Amazon, and I ended up super confused. I want to make things right, and for sure don’t want to steal from a seller, or get accused of theft. 
Is this something I should try contacting the seller directly about, or wait for Amazon to reach out to me once they realize it was actually delivered. Or does anyone know where I can actually go to report it? 
Any help is appreciated, thank you!"

The quality of their products have gone way downhill

The cost of their Prime membership doesn't make sense anymore: A. Their 2 day shipping is mostly gone, everything I order with Prime anymore takes well over a week to be delivered B. Their video service is a complete joke and you can't even opt out of it and pay less. $140 a year for a weeks free shipping and a crappy video service is not needed anymore

Customer Service doesn't exist anymore: they used to have some of the best customer service around, now it's nothing but a maze of robot links telling you to help yourself.

With other companies doing the same thing for way less, amazon doesn't make sense anymore, Walmart+ was just $49 for a full year and you can get same day delivery for free.

edit: i've been transferred to another ""associate"". an actual human?"
"I was charged twice for something I bought once. Can someone help me? I bought a gift for one of my teachers for $30 and it says I’ve been charged twice in my bank app."
"I was supposed to receive my item November 29th, but there is no free locker. They tried again the 30th, but same thing. I haven't heard from them for over a week- it's December 8th. Why haven't they tried delivering a third time?  They won't locate my package or change the delivery address either, so IF they ever attempt a third delivery with a full locker, I believe it will be sent back for a refund anyways. 
I was also told before that if I didn't hear by Dec. 3rd, to call. I did on Dec. 5 and they told me to file an incident report and wait more. ??? I think they lost it.

Has anyone experienced this random week of no tracking updates after attempted deliveries?"
"*subscribe* since I'm also having a problem with a 3rd party seller - which charged me $50 for a personal item which ordinarily retails for around $4. (I thought I was ordering multiples of the item because of Amazon's banner saying I had ordered the product before, which I have - 8 or so of the packages are offered by a different seller for around $50.) Of course the seller won't accept the return.  I can't seem to get help from any of the CS who don't understand what I'm saying, may have to go to my credit card for help which I suspect is becoming more common these days as Amazon's help gets worse and worse.

I'm really going to start thinking twice about ordering from any 3rd party."
"What were you doing that was shady?"
"With the household stuff if your mom or brother has prime and you’re in their household you should have access to prime benefits as well. I am on my mother’s household and I get the benefits from her prime membership. As for seeing orders as long as you are signed into your own separate account with different email and name than theirs they won’t be able to see any of the current or past orders."
"You asked this question before.  Are you expecting a different answer?  

1.  When you do the return via the return system on Amazon, you choose where the money goes.  There is no way to tell what customer service does when you get them to do a return for you.  
2.  Once more, you used customer service to do a return.  If you had used the return system, you could have chosen ""missing or broken parts"" as the reason for a return.  There is no way to tell what reason customer service used for your return.  You will need to contact them again to see what to do.  
4.  It's the way Amazon does business.  There are other online retailers that would have sent you a replacement but not Amazon.
5.  That hasn't been the policy for years."
"What did Amazon say the reason was?"
"I'm confused.  Are you looking for a way besides a web browser?"
"All my shipping estimates more than doubled overnight as well."
"good to know, maybe. Interesting none the less."
"They routinely do that. I have to file complaints with my credit card company each time to get it reversed. Trouble is, that means they issue you a new card, so you have to go for two weeks without a card and then change your card number with all recurring subscription services.

That's just late stage capitalism for you. They take your money, and it's up to you to prove you didn't buy anything."
"It's worth a try. Just say you did not order or subscribe to it."
"We don’t allow hyperlinks."
"Did you really buy them ""by mistake,"" or did you just use that as the default reason?  I would advise using the actual reason instead of the same one each time.  Honesty is always best."
"Something similar is asked frequently.  There is no way to tell when a sale will end."
"I'm not sure that is possible through Amazon.  Have you contacted the manufacturer?"
"You can get insurance for up to 30 days after purchase and that could\* get you a new part and if that part or any other quits working you will be covered for two years. I say ""could"" because I don't know for 100% certainty. Asurion insurance has great customer feedback it would be helpful to read the good vs 1 star reviews first.I looked at one of the most popular bikes on Amazon and found this 1-star-review for a Sunny Health and Fitness  ""If the monitor worked it would be a good bike; Sunny hasn't sent the required part so we will return"". Check the 1 and 2 star reviews, write a review or question and see if the mfg. responds. Do a word search for ""screen"" in the review section and see if anyone had a similar problem and resolved it. Or just save yourself a lot of time and possible frustration and return it for a working one. p.s. these are things I recently learned from my Amazon purchase experience.  edit: Asurion insurance kicks in after the mfg insurance expires."
"I would try to return it."
"I like your idea to refuse delivery. it's tracked so they will show it shipped back. they may ask the reason and you can tell that it took to long and you bought elsewhere.  


On another note, my understanding is if you do NOT open the box you can return for a full refund within 30 days. I agree that customer service is a waste of time."
"We don’t allow hyperlinks."
"Good luck trying to find help even if it's in their favor. If it's something quirky, out of the ordinary I don't think they comprehend out of the norm, Just writing from my experience. I'd try once and if they screw up not to worry, you tried."
"There are scammers and predators out there that try to do sketchy things like this. Or maybe one got access to her account somehow (via phishing?). I think your random creep theory is plausible."
"Bro this is a therapy issue not Amazon lol"
"If you don’t like the rules of this subreddit perhaps you should make your own."
"From what I understand, points can’t be “refunded.”   Guess you’ll find out in 30 days."
"Not often, but it's happened to me a few times when I can the employee can't/doesn't want to find the answer to something. But it's rare."
"Amazon never said anything about “banning for returns.”  I think the colloquial stories show that it usually involved something else shady going on.  Be honest with the return reason, and don’t try to “get over” on Amazon, and you’ll probably be okay."
"We don’t allow hyperlinks."
"What does the tracking say?"
"What did Amazon say the reason was?"
"This is a weekly type of question.  Each county's Amazon is a separate entity.  You will need to buy something from Poland's Amazon."
"We don’t allow hyperlinks."
"A listed return reason is something like ""wrong item received."""
"This has been Amazon’s policy for years now."
"That SAME exact thing happened more than once with me, but lower prices items. Refused to offer sale price, which is the reason I ordered it."
"It couldn't hurt, but you might have to chalk it up as a lesson learned."
"You might want to ask one of the many Amazon seller subreddits."
"It's possible it will.  It's possible it won't.  Get the refund on the 8th.  It doesn't mean that you won't get the item."
"Who told you?  Why won't they deliver it?"
"If no packages were delivered to anyone in your household then why did putting in your dad’s info cause an empty locker door to open? Seems like that is proof that the locker company does have a record of something being delivered since somehow they thought your dad had a package in the locker."
"There is not enough info in your post to answer your questions."
"It's not a ""hack.""  It might be a bug since the locker locations aren't close."
"If you don't have ""confidence"" in Amazon, you can always order from another Amazon retailer."
"We don’t allow hyperlinks."
"Awesome! Thanks for the answer and sorry for the late reply lol"
"Are you an employee of Amazon? If I contact them and reference the information you have given, will they take it seriously?

You're answers seem nonsensical.

For example, you wrote, ""When you do the return via the return system on Amazon, you choose where the money goes. There is no way to tell what customer service does when you get them to do a return for you.""

I used the return system on Amazon and was not offered to choose where the money goes."
"They did not provide a reason but they hypothesized it may be some kind of glitch and would clear up in a few hours. That was 48 hours ago. I’ve since cleared out my wallet except for one card which I know works and has a correct billing address, and the Amazon folks confirmed that there are no flags on my account of any kind."
"I believe they’re asking about signing up for the subscription using their card information instead of the card saved to their google play account. I have an iPhone so I can’t answer but I just know apple does that sometimes so I’m guessing that’s what they’re asking."
"What the hell, actually? They just arbitrarily sign people up for prime? I read an article after I posted this that said the same thing but I didn't believe it. Pretty damn brazen and astonishing. 

I'll try to get it reversed without needing a new card issued, thanks for the response"
"Yeah I'll do that. Through truthfully there isn't a better month to have access to free shipping than December.. but that's also what they want us think I imagine haha"
"I have waited for 2 hours to speak with a supervisor after this post and he gave me another different answer. He said: ""The reward points should go back immediately after the order is cancelled."" Where can I post my complain with my chat screenshot to Amazon? do you know?"
"It says its in transit, but I was worried I did something wrong since it doesn’t say that it is picked up yet on the amazon app"
"I actually just figured it out. There is a free 3 month Kindle Unlimited option, which I wanted. But you can't pay for that with Amazon credit. If I change the option for without that, everything works fine. Sucks though."
"Yeah they however are telling me it's tampered with so I need a report. Could look and try resubmitting again"
"This seems to go against my area's consumer protection act. Essentially it's false advertising merchandise at a lower price and then not honoring it..."
"Yeah that’s what I was thinking. Thanks for the reply, appreciate it."
"I checked with the apartment complex on that front. The last package they had for my dad was the 5th, not today. Sometimes the locker just doesn't register that the item was taken and still thinks one's in there, but the fact of the matter is that no delivery was listed for today for anyone in my family despite the amazon photo, so clearly the driver stole it."
"Do I work for Amazon?  Of course not.  That’s a major “no no” on Reddit.  Will they take us seriously?  Of course not.  You had some questions and I gave you some advice. Do with it what you want.  

Amazon’s return system is very simple.  You have to make two choices.  The reason for the return and where the money goes.  

This is the last response you will get from me concerning this.  

Have a great week!"
"I would imagine you would be okay if you used the supplied label."
"I see."
"I am not a lawyer but but seems they did honor it but it got lost in shipping."
"Ah. Yeah good luck. This seems to be a common issue with any delivery service. I’m currently fighting with USPS because their driver scanned a $200 item as delivered and placed in locker yet they never put the locker key in my box and a search of the locker showed my package isn’t in there. Now both the merchant and USPS say it’s not their problem because it shows “delivered” in the tracking information."
"The UPS guy put the label.  But I have the receipt"
"It got lost on their end though, not porch-pirated on my end. It's literally lost between the amazon warehouse and the courier that *they* hired. So they need to take responsibility and replace the item. If they don't, and insist I re-order at a higher price, then they're not honoring their sale price."
"I'm debating buying the RAM again since I can get it delivered by tomorrow and then either returning the first order if it does show up or getting it refunded, but that would be rewarding Amazon *again* for stealing my shit."
"I’ve also seen on here recently where Amazon is not doing refunds if it shows delivered and tells people to open a case with their local police department."
"## Ideal Scenario: 

> Donating to this cause is the right thing to do. 

## Amazon Scenario: 

> If it doesn’t benefit us, f-em’"
"Can you really blame them? They are participating in the capitalist society. Of course, the only reason there is a PR org in their company is for their benefit.

If a museum displays an artwork that portrays a donor in a negative way, that museum did the right thing as it looks like they did not let the donor list influence their beliefs and integrity. But they did so knowing they would no longer be receiving money from that donor."
"🤷‍♂️"
"These VINE REVIEWS are nothing but bs.

Like this one. ""after extensive research.... I chose to order the \*\*\*"" - NO YOU DIDN'T DO ANY EXTENSIVE RESEARCH. NO YOU DIDN'T ORDER IT.

As seen here: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBPMY588?psc=1&ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_product\_details#customerReviews](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBPMY588?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details#customerReviews)

It's a well known fact, as they discuss it nearly 5 times a day on a private subreddit for VINE REVIEWERS that you must do mostly, if not completely, positive reviews or Amazon removes you from being a VINE REVIEWER.    
They they all talk about how they sell them on Ebay, the Next Door app, Facebook Market Place, Craig's List, etc. etc.    
They clearly say you must give 4 or 5 stars consistently or you lose your ""grave train"" of free products that you can sell for ""REAL MONEY"" as some put it.  

Here is the clearly BS review:

""4.0 out of 5 starsThe system also includes 4 cameras., here are my notes…

Vine Customer Review of Free Product ( What's this? )

This item has been with me for a very short time.

I recently decided to enhance the security of my home, and after extensive research and reading some good reviews, I chose to order the QSEE 8CH 5MP Wired Security Camera System with Human Vehicle Detection. This particular system stood out to me because of its advanced human and vehicle detection feature, and the color night vision. With this technology, I can rest assured that any suspicious activity near my property will be promptly recorded and alerted to me. Additionally, the high resolution of 5MP ensures that every detail will be captured clearly and accurately. The system also includes 4 cameras, allowing for comprehensive coverage throughout my premises.

I hope you find this review helpful.

Amazon legally pursues companies and people who pay others with money or free products to give their items fake Positive reviews. AMAZON IS DOING EXACTLY THE SAME THING."
