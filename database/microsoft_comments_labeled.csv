How do I talk to a real live person about outlook email? Seriously the worst customer service ever.,negative
"I’ve been locked out of my account for three days now. I tried to log onto my Xbox and I was notified that I needed to verify my account which I have had to do about 7 times over the last few months, although I’m not sure why as I never use it for anything other than my Xbox and as a login for my computer. I recently changed my phone number and email however so I could not receive a verification code this time and had to fill out the recovery form. Gaining access to my old email and phone number isn’t an option for me. Every time I’ve filled out the form with as much information as humanly possible I am notified that my identity couldn’t be verified. This means I can’t access my Xbox account or even log on to my computer to access my textbooks and documents for college classes and with finals coming up this needs to be fixed fast. I was even charged for my Xbox subscription the day after my account was locked. Please help, I can’t find anything online other than “fill out another verification form the next day”. I can’t even get Microsoft support to call me without logging on, and I can’t log on without passing this verification form.

Update:

I was locked out for a full month and a half and had completely given up on getting back in to the point that I just made a second account and started using that. One day it just worked out of nowhere. I used the same answers on the recovery form that I had already used a few times before; not at all expecting to get in but for some reason this time it got through. It seems like the most important things to put into the form were previous passwords and linked debit card. Overall though it was a nightmare, Microsoft was no help and neither was Xbox customer support.",positive
"I have been locked out of my Microsoft account for YEARS. I used to play a lot of Xbox and had my gamertag and Office software tied to the same login/account. I have no idea how but at some point my account got locked by Microsoft (presumably someone tried to impersonate me and log into my account?).  Back when this initially happened I tried to recover the account but have never been able to provide sufficient information in the online form to satisfy the robot on the other end. No human has ever been able to help me. Every so often, I give it another try because I would like to recover my personal account (rather than rely on my work-issued laptop for Microsoft software, and I’m considering getting the Xbox Series X whenever one is available). This has been the longest headache and the most infuriating exercise in futility. I tried again just now but got denied once more by the robot. My backup email that would receive my password reset/recovery link has been LONG deleted due to inactivity (the backup email was an AIM email I created in high school, which shows just how futile this all is). I just want a human at MS to please give me back my account that’s been taken from me for seemingly no reason.",negative
"Hi I've been locked out of one of my accounts for a couple of years, going around in circles with the less than helpful microsoft support links - they suggest logging in first. Contacting support requires you also to log on first. I can't log on, the account has been stolen.

It's a hotmail account, and the password redirect email has been changed - I can see part of what it is when I attempt to log on. The security questions also seem like they've been changed as I can't pass the verification. I'd like to have access to this account back.

I've attempted multiple times over the past 2 years to regain access to no avail. Every time the verification form gets filled out it says my identity couldn't be verified, and around in circles yet again. Meanwhile someone still has access to my email account (with some sensitive info on it too).

So how do I go about doing this? Or at least lock the account?

Thanks in advance.",positive
"I have been locked out of my account for days now and any time I attempt to log back in it asks me to verify myself although I have only been logging on to one computer for school and work. Now I am entirely locked out of my account and it wont allow me to verify myself even though I am def giving info that should be working. I can't wait 24 hours again and again to keep getting denied I have important files that I need to access. Why can't I just speak to a person and give my information, it feels like they made this process absolutely daunting for no reason",negative
"I am trying to log into an old hotmail account but I don’t remember the password, I no longer have the phone number linked to the account and the recovery email is lost too. Tried the damn recovery form but since I haven’t used this email for 10 years or more it is impossible for me to remember to whom did I send any email or the exact subject… So of course all the attempts have been denied.

I have been researching this issue all over the internet but found no solution. The support pages have been completely useless.

Is there anyway I can speak to a human to solve this problem?",negative

I tried signing into it but it says I need to use my 2 step authenticator to sign into my 2 step authenticator. I dont have my old phone anymore so that isnt possible. I tried disabling it through my emails on my phone but it asked me to update and once I had updated the app it asked me to sign in, which resulted in it asking me for my 2 step verification code. I am now logged out of both my 2 step verification app AND my email which I need for work and I cannot sign in to any other device until I sort this out. Ive tried getting into contact with anyone from microsoft but when I call their number they just redirect me to their website and ive spent over 2 hours trying to figure out how to talk to an actual human. I think i almost got to a live chat with a support per but it asked me to sign in.

"I have been locked out of my account for a couple of weeks. I used my account for Xbox and my account has been frozen so I can't play anymore and I don't want to lose all the money I've spent for games. At first it said it was because of suspicious acitivity so filled out forms to have my account back and running. But now, when I try to reset the password, I don't recognize the safety email.

"So last night I had my Microsoft account hacked into while I was sleeping. Got a notification on my gmail that my password had changed, and that if I did not initiate this change, to go ahead and go about doing a reset on my password. Thing is, it's been years since I've used this account, so I'm not sure of what information I would use to reset my password, nor would I know what information is on there that someone can steal. 

I filled out three separate account recovery forms, all of which came back and told me I didn't have enough information to authorize getting a password reset. I have now reached my daily allotted form submissions, and can't submit another one for 24 hours. I can't send a pin to my phone, as the phone number has been changed and I don't recognize it. I can't find a number to call to speak with a representative to get this changed over. Hell, I'd be fine with just deleting the account at this point, since I haven't used it in so long. 

Please offer up any advice you can. As I said earlier, I'm incredibly anxious because I don't know what information the people who hacked into my account have, and the longer I wait, the more potential damage can be done. Thanks in advance.",negative

"HELP. I keep getting emails stating that there was unusual sign in activities on my Microsoft account. I was skeptical at first, but now I have reason to believe the worst. Have I been ""hacked""? I've actually been receiving these emails for quite some time now, but ignored them because I thought it was phishing, or whatever. The emails look to have came from the same email address: ACCOUNT-SECURITY-NOREPLY@ACCOUNTPROTECTION.MICROSOFT(.)COM. I don't ever recall making a Microsoft account, unless it was something I needed to do when I first got my laptop and I just don't remember? I decided to go straight to the Microsoft log-in web page at login.live.com and reset my password. After password reset, I went to ""recent activity"" and saw that there were indeed multiple recent activities made onto the account within the past month or so, which includes: multiple unusual activity detected, multiple successful sign ins from different countries, automatic sync....like wtf? Countries ranging from the UK to Nepal to the Netherland, back to the U.S. So, what does all of this mean? Where do I go from here? What else do I need to do? I've already reset my password, as I said. Does this also mean my laptop has been hacked? I know that sounds like a silly question, but now I'm paranoid and anxious, unfortunately. I see the words ""successful sign in"" and ""automatic sync"" and makes me believe that these people (or person) were able to see my personal info and everything I was doing....",negative

"Hi there! My account was recently breached and there is no way for my to recover it. I tried to reset my password, but there is a 2-step verification using a US number that I disconnected earlier this year as I moved out of the country. I could provide information to prove this. I suspect the hacker of altering some security measures I previously had. **I submitted the account recovery application form twice, but it was denied both times by automated response for ""not providing sufficient information""**. I'm worried that the hacker might have access to sensitive information, so if I could retrieve my account, I would be eternally grateful.

I could also provide other personal information that could be found on the account as verification.

"Scared To Install Update
  

  
Microsoft has just released the update for:

"Hello, due to a series of unfortunate circumstances my Microsoft account got stuck in a mess.

I created my Microsoft account long ago using (migrating?) a Hotmail account. Recently I changed the primary e-mail address of the account to a new address, and removed the original one from the authorized log-in aliases.

This somehow wrecked havoc everywhere.

The Hotmail address, which I was using through Outlook.com, got deleted, nut only the address, not the account per se: I no longer can send from and receive e-mail to that address, but the mailbox with all the stored e-mails is still there, reporting however to a random outlook.com address.

My Visual Studio account with its subscription got wiped out, according to VS support VS accounts are tied to the e-mail address used, *not* to the actual Microsoft account used to log-in, so by changing the e-mail address I lost everything and they can't do anything about it.

Microsoft support replied that they can't do anything about it because the problem lies with another department (Outlook.com) and I need to talk to them.

Outlook.com support initial response is that once an alias is removed gets deleted and you can't re-add it. I asked them to escalate the issue and re-add it manually somehow on their end, but I haven't received a reply yet.

I don't know what else to do to fix the issue, frankly it's quite ludicrous that removing a *log-in* alias an entire e-mail account *on an entire different system* gets wiped out without any kind of warning or confirmation.",negative
"I'm kindof at a loss...

I paid for an out of warranty repair for my cracked screen on my Surface Book 3.

I have contacted support twice now (on my third time) and every time they transfer me to technical support whatever call software they're using disconnects me.

Has anyone succesfully had an out of warranty repair to their device? Did I do something wrong? Do I have any other options besides calling support over and over?

Edit: third time was the charm and i was able to reach support. The serial numbers were messed up somehow so ms will pay to have it sent back again and fixed this time. Still frustrating but at least it is getting resolved",positive

My apologies for this late reply as we are also waiting for an update from our higher level of support. We recently receive an update regarding your case and you may check it below:
  

  
Account security is a top priority at Microsoft, and we have a team dedicated to investigating and validating fraudulent activity. The account and billing activity associated with your Microsoft account was thoroughly reviewed by our fraud team, and I can confirm there was unauthorized access to your account. Unfortunately, during the investigation process, we found that your security information has been changed.
  

  
Unfortunately, when security features are updated on an account, we are unable to assist with an account recovery as these types of updates and/or removal are completely out of control of customer service. We are unable to make any changes to the security information on the account due to security protocols set up and the acceptance of the Microsoft Services Agreement when the account was created.
  

  
The only option we have is to permanently suspend this account to prevent any further use. At this time, I have successfully suspended this account, and this will remain on indefinitely.

I didn't subscribe for Microsoft Office but somehow got charged 106.99 for a year of a product I haven't used in 10 years. I'm 31. I'm not in school. I don't have an office job. I haven't used Microsoft office in over 10 years. I have no need for it. I literally have no opened any of their products. Not a single use. I somehow got charged this.

My name, privacy settings, including my phone number was changed. I had two factor verification on that account and I never received an email stating my account, was being signed into or a email was being changed. Every time I try to sign into the account it tells me to enter the hackers email that I do not have access to, if I do it will send an email to that current email that I don’t have access to.

"Recovery on account

I’m trying to get back into my account and seeing if anyone can help. 

I mainly use my account for Xbox and tried to sign on last week. I got a message saying suspicious account activity please verify your account. The only option I have am given is email which is the problem. The email on my account got deactivated since I never use it and created it 10 years ago when I made the account. So I have no way of verifying the code. 

The only other option it gives me is to fill out a recovery form which keeps getting denied. Im filling out everything it asks except security question and previous passwords which I don’t know since the account is 10 years old. 

I’ve called the Microsoft support and they say there is nothing they can do. I really don’t want to make a new account since I have all my 10 years of progress on the account.

"I was gaming on my Xbox last night and was signed out. Trying to sign back in all I got was I was accessing sensitive material and therefore needed my password, I typed it in but it needed the 2 step verification via the app ..... now below 👇 is the complete clown circus Ive been dealing with that is Microsoft help/contact for theast 12 hours 

The authentication wouldn't allow me to authenticat because to do that I first have to sign into the authenticator using ....you guessed it....my sign in. It was a vicious loop that wouldn't allow me to use so I moved onto the text option. Now I KNOW with certainty that the number they have on their file is the one I typed into the recovery page, why? Because I've only had one phone number for the last 25+ years. I typed that in but did not receive any message code back, I have since tried it another 10 times or so and still nothing. So moved onto the last option where it asks me to fill in a verification form that asks a load of random questions regarding my account...I've filled it in 3 times now with that I would say is at least 90% accuracy (the only issue I'm having is remembering a few extra occupants email addresses I would have sent emails to recently) ....buuut guess what, no luck.

Sooooo, ok....as annoying as the above is, it is nowhere near as infuriating as it is trying to contact Microsoft here in the UK. They're whole system feels like is guided at directing you away from contacting them. ALL of their help section and I do mean ALL is a vicious feedback loop that brings to you back to the same point without giving you the direct thing you need ....

It went like this ...

Finally found a phone number on a (not Microsoft page) random internet forum page >> automated response ends up telling me to go to their webpage >> find the correct web page (after some digging) that has details for when Microsoft customer service phone operators are available UK times (but guess what, no phone number) and next to it an option for live chat (but guess what, no button to push). Below all that is a button to push to contact virtual assistant... So finally, ok were getting somewhere >>

>> After traulling through the momentous 'sorry I don't understand, would you like this l, would you like that' dribble I get to the point where I can request a call back or chat online .... I press the call back *you need to sign in* ...I press the chat online option*you need to sign in* 😠🤨😖

I almost throw my laptop, controller, mobile and everything else at this point that Microsoft have been jumping through hoops with .... finally I see the ask community section....I mean, if anyone can cut through this bullshit it would be the community right. Ok let's go ""Click > or ask your own question"" ... click *You nee to sign in*

F#*k you Microsoft......f*#k you!

So now here I am on reddit where I know/hope at least I will get some response. The fact I have to go to a third party platform because of a studio as big as Microsoft make it impossible for you to talk to them regarding such matters is beyond me. All I wanted was one of their team to talk to me/phone me about not being able to sign in but I needed to sign-in in order to do that 🤷🤦

If anyone here has any info on how to get.in contact with Microsoft when you can't actually get in contact them when in a situation like I am would be much appreciated, that or any other help on how to recover/authenticate my account.

Thanks,

"Dear community, dear MS support team,  
I am reaching out to you with an urgent (and somewhat desperate) service request regarding an authentification problem with my MS365 business account. After switching from an old cell phone to a new one the Authenticator app doesn’t work properly anymore, and hence I’m locked out of my account.  
As it happens, I’m the only administrator for my business. So, currently I can’t access my work email account, OneDrive, Teams etc., which is very unfortunate. An official service ticket was opened two weeks ago, but still no one contacted me. I know – and have been told many times now – that the data protection team has a lot of requests. But not being able to access my account seriously harms my business putting me in an unbearable situation.

"Hello,

I have a specific and, likely, unique question regarding microsoft word and animated gifs.

I had created some notes on a word document that uses animated gifs.  I am now trying to move those animated gifs over to a non-Microsoft app but I can't seem to move the actual animation - it just seems to make a ""still"" copy of the gif that does not play.

&#x200B;

I tried to right clicking and ""Save as a picture"" to my desktop but, again, seems like it saved as a still image.

Dragging and dropping the image from the Word document to the non-Microsoft app results in a ""still"" image as well.

Interestingly enough, dragging and dropping the image to another Microsoft app (Word or PPT) results in a proper animated gif.

&#x200B;

Any suggestions on how to extract an animated gif from a word document (btw, I have since deleted the original animate gif file when I added it to the word document).

Thanks!

"Exchange to Microsoft 365 Business Standard

Hi, i just started working with Microsoft CSP and got our first customer, they initially got a Exchange Online (Plan 1) license and now wanted to upgrade their plan to have Office desktop applications, initially thought i could just grab some licenses for Microsoft 365 Business Standard and replace their Exchange plans since what i can find includes the features of Exchange Online (Plan 1)?. 

When i should now deactivate their Exchange license I'm now worried ill some how remove their mail entirely. Since everything is very unclear on how the licensing works, for now ill stick to them having two licenses and I'm paying for it rather than accidentally removing their mail.
  

  
Can some one enlighten me on how this licensing works and if i have some extra steps to take before deactivating their Exchange license?

"Hi there,
  

  
I've been having a problem with certain games on my PC when trying to play them. These games don't 'crash' or 'freeze' as such, they just see to get stuck in and endless cycle of loading which eventually ends in an error message.
  

  
This does not happen with all games, and hasn't happened with any games on Steam. The problems have been purely with games on other launchers (Chivalry 2 - Epic Games Launcher, Sea of Thieves - Xbox launcher).
  

  
The games begin to load up, and go through the opening cinematics of developer logos etc but once they get to the main menu, they seem to get stuck loading.
  

  
Annoyingly, on very very rare occasions, these games do work, but there seems to be no permanent fix.
  

  
I have tried:
  

  
\- Turning internet off and back on
  

  
\- Verifying game files
  

  
\- Updating drivers
  

  
\- Disabling firewalls
  

  
\- Disabling Antivirus
  

  
\- Uninstalling both games and launchers
  

  
\- Google
  

  
\- Emailing the devs
  

  
It's strange because on the very few occasions when I have managed to play these games, they run like butter - so it isn't anything to do with my specifications, these should be fine.

The ""off-line"" refunds team refunded the first 7 but has stonewalled me since, constantly coming back quoting section 16 of the ""Terms of Sale"" as to why the purchases are not eligible for refund. They seem to lack a set of eyes and a brain to assess the situation properly, hiding behind the fact that you can't actually speak to them on the phone, nor do they seem to give you the ability to escalate the issue.

Needless to say, I'm trying to find an avenue to get the proper refunds to my credit card that doesn't involve disputing the charges with my bank, if I can avoid that. It would be great to work it out with you guys, the vendor, as the bank advised I try that first.",positive

Hi  


 I've got a new keyboard. 
  


Periodically it seems to think that a key is being pressed and held when it's not being pressed and held. I'm not sure which key it is, and I was hoping you could help me work that out.
  


Earlier today I was using Microsoft Word and this problem started happening, to check if it was the control key I pressed the letter s. Instead of taking me to the save menu it took me to the references tab and offered me keyboard shortcuts that I have not seen before.
  


Can you work out what was going on?",positive

"I wanted to share my 95 year old grandpa's experience with Microsoft support here, since they have been completely, utterly, and totally useless in every aspect.

* He has had an Office 365 subscription for many years & has been automatically renewing annually

* Microsoft has been automatically charging his credit card for the annual subscription fee

* Because he has been automatically renewing his subscription each year, he had no need to log into his Microsoft account for many years

* Recently, he had to get his computer replaced but in order to use his Office 365 subscription on his new computer, he had to log into his Microsoft account 

* He could not remember his password so he requested to reset his password

* After following Microsoft’s brutal processes and completing multiple Microsoft forms many times, Microsoft continues to deny his request to reset his password

* Microsoft has also refused to issue a credit to his credit card for the portion of the prepaid annual Office 365 subscription that they will not allow him to access.

Beginning June 07, 2021 and to date, he has:

* Logged 5 separate Microsoft Cases

* Had live chat sessions with at least 10 Microsoft Agents, each chat session lasting a minimum of 3 hours to as much as 6 hours per session

* Spent over 1.5 hours on the phone with 2 different Microsoft Agents, half of which was spent on hold, then had both calls disconnected by Microsoft

* Exchanged over 30 E-Mails with at least 4 more Microsoft Agents

* Dealt with at least 3 different Microsoft departments, all of which were equally useless

* Spent in total over 40 hours with Microsoft over 2+ weeks trying to achieve a resolution

Where have we gotten from all this?  Not only does he not have a resolution, he has made absolutely zero progress and is in the exact same situation he was when this started in early June.

He still cannot use his Office 365 subscription because he cannot get Microsoft to allow him to reset his password

He still cannot get Microsoft to refund him for a prepaid annual Office 365 subscription they will not give him access to use

So, Microsoft has locked him out of his account and they won’t refund him for a product (Office 365 subscription) that he paid for in full that they won’t let him use.

Absolutely brilliant.",negative
"Hi, I'm having a new issue today.

I decided to turn on two factor authentication on my Hotmail / Microsoft account.  In doing that, it prompted me to download the authenticator app.  All of that went fine, and I can successfully log in to my Microsoft account with the 2fa on my laptop.

However, I also have email set up on my phone and that is no longer working.  I can see all my previous emails, but cannot send or receive anything new.  When I try to refresh, nothing happens.  Under Account sync, it says Last synced June 26th, 2021 and then a time a couple minutes prior. So it thinks it is syncing.  

I read the section on app passwords, and I believe I am using the default app for email on an Android, so I would need to change it to an app password, but when I go to the incoming messages sync options page where I believe the password field should be just says ""Authentication: Signed in with Microsoft"" and when I click Done, it says ""Problem with Account Setup: Username or Password is incorrect"".

So how do I make it not ""signed in with Microsoft"" so I can change the password to an app password?  Or if ""signed in with Microsoft"" is right, is this something I fix in the authenticator app?  I've spent a couple hours researching and digging and cannot find any answer.",negative

"Hello. 

When I was setting up my Microsoft Outlook account, I clicked on a setting that would make the system ask me to  change my password every 3 months. 

When I was prompted to change my password, I had to use the ""reset password"" route. Since I also had 2 way verification turned on, it asked for my phone number, which I entered correctly, but I didn't have my security code with me. 

Thus, the account has to go through the 30-day waiting period before I could reset my password. This waiting period started on June 6th, so I'm supposed to be able to reset my password on July 6th. I'm not able to log in right now. 

Today, I went to the login page and tried the ""reset password"" steps again to see what the website will say. Instead of saying ""your wait time is not over,"" the website asked me to give an alternative email address so I can wait for 30 days to get reset information. 

Does this mean I will not be receiving the reset information on July 6th? Why doesn't the system recognize I already requested for reset on June 6th and that I'm due to receive information on July 6th? Please help. Thank you.",positive

"I have 2 issues. I downloaded a few games on Xbox 360 and when I got a Xbox one most of those games didn't transfer over. When I tried to talk to someone about this I kept getting the run around like I was lying or something because the games were free so it didn't show up as something that I owned. But it transferred the other games that I got for free. So now I'm on Xbox one and I don't even have the DLC's that came with the games and I have proof that I paid for those. 

Number 2.... I bought some in game currency for a game I'm playing currently. It still hasn't reflected on the game yet and I bought it on the 27th of June. It's now July 2nd and it still hasn't been reflected on the game yet. I tried to talk to someone and they didn't help at all. It's like they didn't even try to understand what I was saying. 

I just don't understand if y'all are sitting in front of the computer looking at my information and still ask for me to look for order numbers just to prove that I really did want I said I did. Just give me a email address so I can send pics and documentation to prove my point. Just saying.",positive

Since instalation two years ago I have noticed that automatically all my files and folders created on my laptop had yellow lock on icons, and if I wanted to share them with others via usb or send them, I had to unlock them in properties first and it worked. Downloaded files didn't have that mark.   
On July 1st I turned my laptop on, had some automatic Windows updates and I unlocked folder on desktop so I can put it on USB and on other pc.But then, I saw that on my laptop some of desktop shorcuts were blank and not working, and that some photos on desktop don't have preview anymore, just blank icon, I tried to open them, but it said that ""encrypted file can't be opened"". I checked all my documents and oh God, many folders with photos and pdf, even videos were randomly locked.  I 'm getting the error 0x80071771 and although I am administrator and owner of files, I cannot decrypt them. I did not encypt my files!I don't have backup because my laptop is old and full and there's no enough space.  


My computer repair technician was afraid that I had cryptovirus or ransomware but after examining there was nothing found on my laptop.   
I tried:  
1 system restore (but for some reason had only one previous date saved although I saved several before)  
2 unchecking box for encryptng files in file property (it can't be changed because ""you don't have administrator licence"")  
3 checked and confirming ownership on files and folders  
4 deleting recent windows updates (one of them seems impossible to be deleted- KB5003637, even with Running Windows Update Standalone Installer (wusa.exe) with the /uninstall).I went to the ""Recovery"" settings page.   The "" go back to the previous version of Windows 10""  option states that it is ""no longer available because your PC was updated more than 10 days ago.I let windows do the most recent update, nothing changed.  
5 Repair technician used Linux to check and there was no viruses or malware, hardware is working properly, checkdisk and repair disk didn't help einther. He couldn't change properties of files from Linux.  
6 since the problem occured, system offered exporting certificates and keys  but I don't know how to use that. I noticed two certificates made on the date of problem, and about one month before.My os is Windows 10 pro version 2004, OS build 19041.1052

"Successful logins from IE with my same IP, location and without asking for 2FA

Hi! So I’ve been detecting this issue recently. On my MS account activity, there’s successful logins from IE, without requesting my 2FA. That activity always has my same IP and my correct location. For context, I’ve changed my password recently multiple times, and as I stated, I also have 2FA activated. I’ve seen other people have this same issue [(example)](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/successful-sign-ins-from-internet-explorer-on-my/d19158a2-5b4e-436c-a705-99fba1fc5c42) 

I already contacted Support about this and they said I don’t need to worry as long as the activity has my correct IP and location, and that the activity may be caused by some application or program that uses IE as a default, like Office service and such.

I have to say I have to use IE from time to time, but I never log in from there, I am required to use it for something else completely unrelated to MS. Also, I’ve run Malwarebytes and Windows complete scans and there’s no issue about that. After this activity my account information and settings remain the same and my password isn’t changed either.

Does anyone know what could be causing this activity? Is this normal? Should I be worried, since it contains my correct IP and location?",negative

"I am having a very bizarre set of problems on Windows 10 Home 64-bit. It's difficult to explain in text, but I'll try. I can compose a video showcasing the problems, but I'd only send the link in a DM.

1. Sometimes, the taskbar overlaps full screen videos. This has been going on for several weeks at least. I've been using the task manager to restart windows explorer, which maybe has caused the new problems?
2. When I use the search menu in the taskbar, my cursor is taken to another part of the menu, and I need to click the search bar again to type. When I do, it only accepts the first character and autocompletes with the most recent app that fits the result. I cannot delete the search or use backspace and must start again to do a new search.
3. When I open Snip & Sketch, the cursor is moved to the right continuously at a medium speed. I can fight against it, but it doesn't stop the motion. I can make a snip and then open the editor.

"**W10 - English/International Shortcuts while another system language is set?**

Windows 10 seems to accept shortcuts according to the set language (not the set keyboard language, but the actual language set for the system - UI etc.). With English set as language ctrl+b makes things bold. With German set as language crtl+shift+f (""fett""=""fat"") is the equivalent.

This can be rather annoying as - when having the system set to German - e.g. Reddit allows for crtl+b, but Windows Mail demands ctrl+shift+f. Therefore my question: **Is it possible to set the ""language"" of the shortcuts seperately from the language of the system (UI etc.) natively?** I would like to keep my system German, but use English shortcuts...

"Hey there! That's an interesting question, and we appreciate your interest in upgrading to Windows 11.

By default, all your files and data will transfer. However, we recommend backing up your files before installation. After you have installed the Windows 11 upgrade, there is a 10-day period where you can move back to Windows 10 while keeping files and data that you brought along with you. After the 10 days, you will need to back up your data and do a “clean install” to move back to Windows 10. Downloading and installing Windows 11 will most likely take longer than a typical Windows 10 feature update. You can use your PC while you’re downloading Windows 11 and then you have the option to schedule the install to happen at a specific time when you aren’t planning on using your PC.

"1. It's not locked, we just can't add it to a new device (new phone) - after entering the email and password it says it has detected suspicious activity and needs to verify our identity by sending a text. The phone number it then displays is our landline, not our mobile number, so the verification text never arrives. Texting to landlines does work (the phone should ring, and the text is read out by a bot) but I guess microsoft doesn't bother trying.

"Hi again! How are you today?

We are sending this follow-up message to ensure that everything is being covered and assisted accordingly. Please feel free to message us back with your answers at the soonest possible time to address all your concerns about your wife's Hotmail account.

"Thank you for reaching out to us. We're saddened to hear that your account has been compromised, and your sign in information has been changed. We also understand your credit cards has been used fraudulently, and we certainly didn't want you to go through this experience. In addition, we appreciate your effort in trying to reach our to our support for assistance. 

When there is an unauthorized attempt to sign in to your account or if someone is attempted to change your sign in email address, you should be notified, and you will have the chance to secure your account and fortify it.

However, we'd like to set your expectation that once the primary sign in preference of an account has been removed or changed, you will need to use the new primary email address it was changed to try to recover your account using the account recovery form.

Also, we'd like to ask the following questions for us to assist you better:

1. Is two-step verification enabled on your account?

2. Do you still have access to the security information (alternate email address or phone number) of your account, or was the security information changed as well?

3. Did you receive a notification regarding an unauthorized password reset request or a security information change?

4. Do you have any active Microsoft subscriptions tied up with your account?

5. Have you already tried using the account recovery form: https://msft.it/61698i6TYr?

Furthermore, we recommend contacting your financial institution/bank to block unauthorized charges to your account and possibly request for a chargeback.

We hope this information helps. Thank you for your service!

"How's it going? We'd like to check back with you on this case, as it is our aim to assist you further.

We have recently informed that you should get a notification once there is an attempt to access your account or change your account information, as this will give you the chance to apprehend the attempt and secure your account. We also advised you to use the new username/email address of your account to fill out the account recovery form. 

We also asked you some questions for us to properly assist you. However, we haven't heard back from you. Do you still need our assistance?

Moreover, we recommend investigating the unexpected charges from Microsoft using the information on this link: https://msft.it/61696i6hOM

If you don't see the cause for your unexpected charge, please take note that chargebacks, or transaction reversals, happen when you inform your bank, credit card company or other financial institution such as PayPal, that you dispute a payment made by them on your behalf, on the grounds that it took place without your consent. Sometimes your financial institution may contact you to report a suspicious transaction and, if you agree, initiate a dispute on your behalf.

Please take note that if a chargeback claim is raised against a payment made to Microsoft, we will assume that the payment was made without consent and that the personal details have been compromised. If you have any doubts about a payment made to Microsoft, we recommend that you check the order history before disputing the charge to prevent an unnecessary chargeback and potential account suspension. If you are certain that a transaction was fraudulent, please contact the financial institution to cancel the payment method and to prevent further charges to your account, as well as to raise a possible dispute.

Feel free to contact us again at your most convenient time if you need our assistance on this case. We'd be glad to continue assisting you.

Take care, and have a nice day.

"Hi RR,

Thank you for your reply.  Let’s be clear: a hacker changed the email address associated with my account and then quickly changed our username and password.  We attempted dozens of times to recover the account without success.  The hacker has access to all of our files and personal information.  The hacker has attempted charges on all of our accounts.  It’s a nightmare.  MSFT is absolutely zero help.  We have contacted the local police, FBI, the SSA, credit bureaus, and all of our financial institutions.   We’d just like to get access to our account and close / delete it.  

Specifically:
1) we did not have 2 step verification on our MSFT account. Rookie mistake on our part.  We didn’t even realize we could do this after having MS accounts on both our personal and government computers for over a decade.
2) we’re not sure if we have access to the security information.  When we type in our email address (our original login), it says the account associated with that email address has a new username and email address.  We have screenshots of the new username and e-mail address associated with OUR account…and an IP address.  I was surprised actually that we didn’t get a more personal response like mother_of_all_dogs above.  I was excited to see that someone actually responded to this individual.  Talking to a MS human being would be a godsend and what we need.  
3) We did receive an email that the email address associated with our account had changed.  Almost immediately we tried logging in or recovering the account and nothing worked.  Shortly thereafter the username and  password was changed.
4) We DO have an active MSFT subscription on this account - we paid for a 1 year subscription to office 365 and as far as we know this is active.
5) we have tried the account recovery form dozens of times .  You’re limited to 2-3x per 24 hours so this slowed our ability to recover with the info we had

We’d just like to talk with someone at MSFT who can help.  Again, it’s shocking when all of your files and personal information is in the cloud, that cloud gets hacked, and recovery is impossible.  And there’s no one to help except for an automated recovery form that doesn’t work.  It’s a nightmare.  We are not young…this is impacting our teenage/college children as well and their credit cards (CC) associated with us…we’ve seen a lot and we will absolutely fight this and spread the word.   

Finally, we immediately within that first day changed and locked down all our accounts and financials.  These hackers have used our new days-old CC # (several of them to be a little more exact) since from what we believe and have been told by our financial institutions that these CC numbers automatically refresh in Microsoft accounts.  When will this stop - we are not sure BUT we do know that the start of all of this lies with our MS account that we need to secure.

I’d love to have a private conversation to discuss further and share the information we have (screenshots, the hacker’s email address, new username, ip address, etc).",positive

Without a warning or a sign.

I don't know if it's an algorithm, or just some people in Microsoft saying:

\-Hey, look. This guy is collecting points all year, and he surely is going to get his gift card tomorrow.

\-Oh, yeah? Remove that gift card from his options.

I posted here because:

1. I want Microsoft to know, that I am not okay with whatever they are doing. Gifting stuff like this to people is a big deal, and I am sure it costs them a lot of money.

And that's why it's very important to do it the right way. It is a reason for me to stop using their services, so they can see that this kind of behavior is not acceptable to me.

"I see. Would you still recommend I take up the vendor role? I think what you mentioned about the respect and brand name is what’s also pulling me towards the new offer, although I was wondering how much impact working as a contractor(and not fte) at Microsoft will have on future opportunities. 

As for being silo’ed at Microsoft, I’m going in not expecting to be converted to FTE. I’ve done my research on it and it seems that it’s possible but very rare, so if it happens, good. If not, I’m not going to sweat it. And I believe as a vendor I will be subject to certain isolation anyway :/

Some MSPs do the same stuff every day for really big customers and have little variation or growth. Being in house lets you deploy and support to get full depth of knowledge. 

I’ve worked for Microsoft in MCS, worked for 9 Microsoft Partners, and worked in various IT organizations.  Trust me, it isn’t the company but the opportunity and most importantly the manager you will be working for that should guide your decision. 

Most people don’t leave a job, they leave a bad manager.",positive

There’s barely any tech involved in my current role. No coding or data wrangling or writing SQL queries so far (and that probably won’t change much). It’s mostly creating visualisations and building stories and dashboards on a Tableau type platform.

Like I said, my current role is easy going and it’s probably something I’d choose if I was close to retirement (typical government role). But as a new grad who is also new to the US job market there is no learning and I’m afraid the more time I spend here, the less I have to show for actual hands on data skills that could help me land future roles.",positive
Do you mean there’s less opportunities to network with people I’d work with at Microsoft?,positive
"Thank you so much for your responses :)
I’ve been overthinking and questioning the risks. But the opportunities, or even potential opportunities you talk about make it seem worth it. 

I also feel like at this stage in life (trying to build my career) it’ll be better to take up something more challenging with a learning curve even if it has more risk, than being at cushy but low paying government job where I don’t learn anything or grow/improve myself.",positive
"I was part of MCS (MSFT FTE) in the past. I wanted out after 2yrs. And I loved being a consultant (the role), so it was definitely the “feeling” silo’d out. Also MSFT is notorious for reorgs. I went through 5 diff managers in 4yrs. Also (off topic but, MSFT Teams is incredibly isolating, I can’t imagine working without Slack).

Jumped to sales and MUCH MORE happier now, but I’m also the type that loves to talk all day and be in presentations, etc.

I would try to find a startup tbh. It’s a lot faster paced; learn new technology, and overall more growth opportunities. If not a startup, then a more “startup-esque” company.

I was in MSFT after graduating from university, and while it was an amazing opportunity, I felt like I would’ve probably liked it better when I’m a lot older and ready to rest and vest.",positive

I’ve seen this word being used a lot with Microsoft. As a vendor/consultant, I’m assuming I’d be isolated anyway if I’m not mistaken. To top it off, it’s fully remote so outside of the virtual meetings, I don’t really think I’d interact with people much or have any input on anything.

"One part of the ux I don't like with this is that they're effectively fake emails, they have a delete button on them like others. However one problem is that their delete button is not in the same place as other disjointing the experience trying to read mail and quickly delete unneeded ones as you go.

On the old native windows mail, I'd highlight the top message delete button and start hitting it then the next message would slide into view and I'd keep hitting delete.

With this web style thing there's two problems. A) the delete button does not line up with others breaking me away from quickly buzzing through mail this way. And B) Messages don't load as fast I don't know on a web app if this is fixable speed wise or not, before I could quickly mash delete by clicking as the next message rolled up into the same spot with delete under my cursor already. Now though, messages load slower. If I try to mash I will inevitably click a spot where the trash button on the message moving up hasn't loaded yet, which forces me to click the background before the button loads instead, which results in a new window with the message opening instead of deleting it, messing my whole flow up.",negative

"tl;dr: +1 for Thunderbird. Or [Betterbird](https://www.betterbird.eu/#featuretable). I've been used it as my main personal email client for about three years now.

I absolutely hate New Outlook, and hating it seems to be common among traditional Outlook power users. It's missing too many features at the moment. The native Windows Mail app is also not very good. 

A few years ago, my personal details, including my hotmail address, were sold to spammers in a tranche of data harvested and sold by temporary, unvetted COVID-callcenter employees. It was a minor national scandal. Ever since that breach, I get truckloads of spam in my hotmail accounts' inbox. As I've had the address since 1996 and I quite literally use it for everything important, getting between 40 and 90 spam mails in your inbox is highly annoying, the contents often leads to malicious, malware spreading websites. Before that data theft, I got just a few spam mails a week.

There are certain technologies that you can enable on email servers, which will reduce the amount of unwanted email considerably. One of these is [SPF.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework) Unlike the paid for Office365, which does handle it correctly, [Outlook.com](https://Outlook.com) does not adhere to the result of an SPF-check. The header is still there though, so in Thunderbird, you can easily create a filter based on the SPF header and move all mails that do not have spf=pass as a property to a folder of your choosing. I scroll through it once a week but I have yet to find an email that shouldn't have been in there/false positive. This method misses just a few every month.",negative

Reason: (at a very high level)

1. SPF leverages the envelope header, meaning you can get an SPF=Pass for the sending email system, like sendgrid.net, although the header from could be domain.com.

2. Some senders will not put a sending server in their SPF DNS record, as bad actors can leverage an existing system to send spam, etc.

3. DMARC leverages both DKIM and SPF, where at least one must pass, and neither can fail.

Until you lose customers to larger partners because they have and can demo the product.  First the partner program was made near impossible for partners to qualify and now a huge limitation on THE new product going to just the largest partners.,negative
"I worked in MCS for 6.5 years.  I am now with my 9th partner in my 30 year career.  Yes, I did not talk to everyone at Microsoft, but from the twenty or so that I know, they have all had Copilot since it was initially made available internally.

You are talking about selling with videos, yes, of course, people who buy anything new will jump with just that.  What you are missing is that I cannot sell it at all.  It is not available to even sell from CSP.  Not only that, I cannot get it myself since we also use the CSP model or licenses from the partner program.  Our largest licensing customers that can go direct now are thinking of doing that because they get access to Copilot now versus who knows when.

Microsoft has not done this with ANY other product or offering.  Sure, they have had private preview and selected TAP programs, but they have never released a product like this before.  Making it GA only to enterprise customers and requiring a minimum of 300 seats.  Everything has always been available to the partner community for us to deploy, learn, and extend with our own professional services.

No, you are wrong in your interpretation of my comment.",negative

"Do you use Outlook? Good to check for rules they may have set up in the web app. I have seen compromised accounts where they create rules to immediately conceal messages by marking as read or deleting, good to check. 

Other advice is great, you’ll want to work through your list of accounts and I recommend using a password manager (with a master password that doesn’t match anything else) so that when you update your passwords they’re strong, and you can track them.

It doesn’t sound like it, but is this tied to a work / school account? If it is reach out to them as soon as possible.

Either way, don’t panic and make an offline list of accounts (on paper) and work through them updating passwords, if you use Windows and your Microsoft account to log in you can update your PIN if you use one. You already made a great move enabling 2FA. Recommend if possible using an authenticator app (Microsoft Authenticator, Authy, etc.) instead of SMS codes if possible. Monitor your finances for anything unusual.

I do primarily use Outlook, I'll need to check the rules. It's all so complicated, I went through a bunch of stuff already and there is so much more.

This email is not linked to work and I have a different one with a private domain for my uni, that one only forwards mails to the affected one. Would this still be a risk?

I use the email for a bunch of online shop's accounts and paypal, but there's no logging into my paypal without my phone. I'm still checking for unusual activity regardless.

There was no series if attempted logins from India, there were others in my country. Those happened for 3 weeks straight every few hours.

"You should assume full compromise of any linked accounts, especially those that may use the email address as recovery, 2FA/MFA and contact.

Assume your credentials may have been used to set up services and you may get mails from those services.

For your other account, if you didn’t see them attempt to access it, my primary concern would be if you believe it forwarded something previously that could be sensitive the attacker may have accessed; it’s probably best to change that account password as well, or reach out to your uni and confirm there weren’t any suspicious access attempts.",positive

If you don't want that, you still don't need to do a fresh Windows install.  You can just add another account and then log in with that one.  You'll have to deal with redoing any per-user installation of stuff and moving your documents and whatnot.

Another option is to create a new local account, which lets you give it a name that results in the path you want, and then remove the MSA from your current account, log into the new local account, and associate that one with the correct MSA.",positive

Yes.  Multiple accounts can share the same MFA phone number.  That being said: recommendations these days are to move to the MS Authenticator App (or equivalent) rather than SMS based MFA codes.  

That (that) being said: nearly any MFA is better than none.  Adding MFA and removing Global Admin access from a general daily use account already reduces risk immensely.  SMS hijacking / interception / spoofing are definitely threats.

Edit: I should add my endorsement to having a separate admin level account in general.  And that account should never be logged into or used for anything other than admin level tasks.  It greatly reduces the risk of session hijacking or password theft if you only access the account specifically at [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com) rather than logging in after clicking on a link in a random email.

It's not in my startup items. I checked. It would also not explain why it's running five windows now. Closing them lasts under a minute before they're back. IDK, this is all very strange.",negative
"Very... Strange!

Are you sure you don't have a stuck key on your keyboard or something?  If multiple apps are having this ""auto open"" behavior, it makes me think something is sending it an open command... And I've had a key get stuck, that was doing it.",positive
"Thanks for the tip. I'm sure it's not that, using on screen keyboard ATM, but I appreciate you're trying to help, and I, and others can prob use the info in the future.",positive
"Any chance then that it's a bad touch sensor in the screen? Was chrome and mail in the same spot on the Taskbar when this happens?

... Could be that the screen is sensing a touch there, thus always opens the app.",negative
"It's on screen keyboard operated with my mouse, it's an accessibility option in windows.  This prob did start when I mistakenly opened mail app because it was on the taskbar, don't normally use it. I unpinned it.  You're right though. Something must be commanding it to open. Malwarebytes says no infections.",negative
"Test it out.... Pin a different program there, and see if it also starts opening etc... If it's a touchscreen, I'd highly suspect a touchscreen malfunction.",negative
"Well, not a touchscreen.",positive
You don't need to. Just live in 2023 and respect the planet. Those emails aren't going anywhere. Save the attachments to your onedrive. It'll be fine and more useful than paper.,positive

"I’m an engineer at Microsoft (non-software). It’s hard to get in. The interview process in my org goes like this:
- phone interview with hiring manager. Depending on the manager, he/she may ask you to solve a technical question. 
- phone screen with a technical question to answer 
- Panel interview with 2-3 engineers with an incredibly difficult architecture problem to solve 
- individual interviews with 2 or 3 other engineers. Each with their own technical question 
- if you pass all that, you’ll interview with the skip-level manager
- if everyone likes you and skip manager likes you, the hire decision will be made pretty quickly. 

At least an my org, we don’t interview groups of people and make a decision. It’s done on a per-candidate basis. So you’ll know we want to hire you pretty quickly. You’re not compared with other candidates. 

Also, in my org, we’re pretty light on the behavioral questions. But the technical questions are pretty devastating. 

Honestly, the only way to prepare is to know your fundamentals. 

They prefer to hire people with a Masters or a PhD",positive
"I’m a software PM (long time in Scott’s org) and im curious: what’s the skillset of a hardware pm? Not looking to transition at this point in my career, I’ve just always wondered",positive
Perfect thanks.  I'm rusty on fundamentals because I do so many different things. Every project I do is something new so I am continuously learning (20years exp).,positive
"With 20 years experience, you’ll probably be interviewing for an L65 position. Principal Engineer. Expect leadership and higher-level systems questions. Also, you mentioned “continuously learning”. Lean into that. One of the big mantras here is “growth mindset”.",neutral
"I'm not sure if I understand you correctly.

You can use up to 5 devices with one Microsoft 365 Subscription, but its still only for 1 user.

Or do you mean the family subscription with up to 5 users? For that you don't need to do any of what you described.",negative
"Yeah, the family account. My friend already shares it with his brother, but now wants to add his girlfriend to it, and cancel her account... But she needs to keep all her OneDrive files safe and is scared of losing everything.",negative
"Ah, I see.

She must not cancel her account, only her subscription. Big difference ;)

And your friend, supposedly the subscription holder, only needs to add her email/account to the family subscription.
