# Individual Project IV - A publicly accessible auto-scaling container using Azure App Services and Flask.

## Project Scope

As digital platforms burgeon with user-generated content, the ability to gauge public sentiment through this data has become invaluable for businesses and researchers alike. Sentiment analysis, a cornerstone of Natural Language Processing (NLP), seeks to systematically identify, extract, and quantify the affective states and subjective information embedded within text data. Despite its potential, sentiment analysis poses inherent challenges, such as detecting nuances, sarcasm, and context-specific meanings, which often elude traditional analytical tools.

This project contributes to the field by developing a sophisticated sentiment classification system trained on an extensive corpus of Amazon user reviews. The focus is to discern positive and negative sentiments, thereby providing granular insights into consumer opinions. In aligning with ethical data use, the acquisition of the 20,000-user review dataset was conducted in strict adherence to the platform's terms of service, ensuring respect for user privacy.
